SDNET2018 is an annotated image dataset for training, validation, and benchmarking of artificial intelligence-based crack detection algorithms for concrete. SDNET2018 contains over 56,000 images of cracked and non-cracked concrete bridge decks, walls, and pavements. The dataset includes cracks as narrow as 0.06 mm and as wide as 25 mm. The dataset also includes images with a variety of obstructions, including shadows, surface roughness, scaling, edges, holes, and background debris. SDNET2018 will be useful for the continued development of concrete crack detection algorithms based on deep learning convolutional neural networks, which are a subject of continued research in the field of structural health monitoring.

Our CNN model achieved an accuracy of 97 percent in classifying the images based on cracks and no cracks

We experimented with several transfer learning models and implemented K-fold cross validation to achieve best results

The results are depicted in the confusion matrix at the end of the notebook
